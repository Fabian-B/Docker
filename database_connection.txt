Trusted_Connection=True; --> gebruikt windows credentials

f you don't want to use integrated security / trusted connection, you need to specify user id and password explicitly in the connection string 
(and leave out any reference to Trusted_Connection or Integrated Security)

The connectionstring wordt dus:
server=yourservername;database=yourdatabase;user id=YourUser;pwd=TopSecret
